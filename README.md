# Symbol Linking

![Gif demo of using the @ symbol to link to a name in Persons/](./docs/at-linking-example-1.4.4.gif)

Adds the ability to link using any trigger symbol in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). Can limit the trigger linking to specific folders e.g. `People/`, or even a specific file (link will be done as a heading in the file).

Supports [aliases](https://help.obsidian.md/Linking+notes+and+files/Aliases) (nicknames for a file) that you can set in the properties/metadata of a note via the `alias` or `aliases` field.

## Settings
The plugin uses the link type specified by your Obsidian `"Files & Links" -> "Use [[Wikiliks]]"` setting.
- Turn on compatibility mode to enable the linking when plugins that show suggestions like the [Tasks plugin](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks) are enabled.
- Optionally include the trigger symbol in the final link text, e.g. `[@evan](./evan.md)` as opposed to `[evan](./evan.md)` (all trigger symbol will follow this setting.)


### Linking to directories/files
You can limit links to:
 - From specific directories, like your `People/` directory.
 - **Or** from **specific files**, like your `People.md` file. You can configure the level heading using the slider.

#### Folder linking

The folder linking also includes the option to limits or add more extensions. You can set up multiple extension as a list, on the form of `md, pdf, jpg, jpeg`. Separate the extension by a comma, a space or a new lines. You can even to limit to a particular extension, for example, limiting to image with `png, jpg, jpeg, webp`.

> [!warning]
> Linking to an image will always embed it.

### Creating not found links
Depending on the previous settings, the creation of a not found "link" will:
 - Create a new note from a template in a specified directory (for directories linking)
 - **Only if a path is set in the `Use one file for all links`**, append the contact name in the file, as heading.

It is also possible to set a trigger per files or folders. By default, the default trigger will be set when a new folder/file is added.

## Hotkeys

Supports `up`, `down`, `enter`, and `escape` keys for navigating the link search popup.

## Installing

- [x] Using BRAT with https://github.com/mara-li/obsidian-symbol-linking â†’ Or copy and open obsidian://brat?plugin=mara-li/obsidian-symbol-linking in your explorer or browser. It will automatically open Obsidian and install the plugin.
- [x] From the release page:
  - Download the latest release 
  - Unzip obsidian-custom-suggester.zip in .obsidian/plugins/ path 
  - In Obsidian settings, at "Community Plugin", reload the plugin list 
  - Enable the plugin (or reload it if already installed)

## Limitation

- The suggester doesn't show up in the properties when you use the mode "live-preview"
- If used in properties in source mode, you must add the `"` around the link, like : `"[[file]]"`, otherwise it will be broken.
- For image, it always link to an embed, even if you are in the properties part.
